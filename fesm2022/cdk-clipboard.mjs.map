Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord ` +\n    `of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the ` +\n    `midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could ` +\n    `even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway ` +\n    `to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only ` +\n    `thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. ` +\n    `Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice ` +\n    `killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.`;\n}\n"],"names":["CdkClipboardOverviewExample","deps","target","i0","ɵɵFactoryTarget","Component","isStandalone","selector","ngImport","template","FormsModule","kind","type","i1","DefaultValueAccessor","NgControlStatus","NgModel","inputs","outputs","exportAs","ClipboardModule","i2","CdkCopyToClipboard","decorators","imports","styles"],"mappings":";;;;;;;MAkB2FA,2BAAA,CAAA;WAEJ,kFAAA,CAAA,IACC,oFAAA,CAAA,kFACF,GAClF,CAAA,qFAAA,CAAA,8FAVS,CAAA,iFAAA,CAAA,gLANH,kFAAA,CAAA;;;;;UAWiFA,2BAAA;IAAAC,IAAA,EAAA,EAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,MAAA,EAAAC,EAAA,CAAAC,eAAA,CAAAC;AAAA,GAAA,CAAA;;;;UAAAL,2BAAA;IAAAM,YAAA,EAAA,IAAA;IAAAC,QAAA,EAAA,gCAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,QAAA,EAAAL,EAAA;AAAAM,IAAAA,QAAA;;;;YAFDC;AAAA,KAAA,EAAA;MAAAC,IAAA,EAAA,WAAA;MAAAC,IAAA,EAAAC,EAAA,CAAAC,oBAAA;MAAAP,QAAA,EAAA;AAAA,KAAA,EAAA;MAAAI,IAAA,EAAA,WAAA;MAAAC,IAAA,EAAAC,EAAA,CAAAE,eAAA;MAAAR,QAAA,EAAA;AAAA,KAAA,EAAA;MAAAI,IAAA,EAAA,WAAA;MAAAC,IAAA,EAAAC,EAAA,CAAAG,OAAA;MAAAT,QAAA,EAAA,qDAAA;MAAAU,MAAA,EAAA,CAAA,MAAA,EAAA,UAAA,EAAA,SAAA,EAAA,gBAAA,CAAA;MAAAC,OAAA,EAAA,CAAA,eAAA,CAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAA,CAAA,SAAA;AAAA,KAAA,EAAA;MAAAR,IAAA,EAAA,UAAA;AAAAC,MAAAA,IAAA,EAAAQ;AAAA,KAAA,EAAA;MAAAT,IAAA,EAAA,WAAA;MAAAC,IAAA,EAAAS,EAAA,CAAAC,kBAAA;MAAAf,QAAA,EAAA,sBAAA;MAAAU,MAAA,EAAA,CAAA,oBAAA,EAAA,4BAAA,CAAA;MAAAC,OAAA,EAAA,CAAA,0BAAA;AAAA,KAAA;AAAA,GAAA,CAAA;;;;;;QAEClB,2BAAA;EAAAuB,UAAA,EAAA,CAAA;;;gBAZxF,gCAAA;AAAAC,MAAAA,OAAA,EAUuF,CAAAd,WAAA,EAAAU,eAAA,CAAA;MAAAX,QAAA,EAAA,iPAAA;MAAAgB,MAAA,EAAA,CAAA,0DAAA;AAAA,KAAA;;;;;;"}
