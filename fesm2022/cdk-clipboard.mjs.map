I thought not. It's not ` +\n    `a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord ` +\n    `of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the ` +\n    `midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could ` +\n    `even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway ` +\n    `to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only ` +\n    `thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. ` +\n    `Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice ` +\n    `killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.`;\n}\n","<label for=\"clipboard-example-textarea\">Text to be copied</label>\n<textarea id=\"clipboard-example-textarea\" cols=\"30\" rows=\"10\" [(ngModel)]=\"value\"></textarea>\n<button [cdkCopyToClipboard]=\"value\">Copy to clipboard</button>\n"],"names":["CdkClipboardOverviewExample","value","deps","target","i0","ɵɵFactoryTarget","Component","ɵcmp","ɵɵngDeclareComponent","minVersion","version","type","isStandalone","selector","ngImport","template","styles","dependencies","kind","FormsModule","ClipboardModule","i2","CdkCopyToClipboard","inputs","outputs","decorators","args","imports"],"mappings":";;;;;;;MAaaA,2BAA2B,CAAA;AACtCC,EAAAA,KAAK,GACH,CAAoF,kFAAA,CAAA,GACpF,CAAsF,oFAAA,CAAA,GACtF,+EAA+E,GAC/E,CAAA,qFAAA,CAAuF,GACvF,CAAA,sFAAA,CAAwF,GACxF,CAAmF,iFAAA,CAAA,GACnF,oFAAoF,GACpF,CAAA,gFAAA,CAAkF,GAClF,CAAoF,kFAAA,CAAA;;;;;UAV3ED,2BAA2B;AAAAE,IAAAA,IAAA,EAAA,EAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,MAAA,EAAAC,EAAA,CAAAC,eAAA,CAAAC;AAAA,GAAA,CAAA;AAA3B,EAAA,OAAAC,IAAA,GAAAH,EAAA,CAAAI,oBAAA,CAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,UAAA,EAAA,QAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,OAAA,EAAA,QAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,IAAA,EAAAX,2BAA2B;ACbxCY,IAAAA,YAAA,EAAA,IAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,QAAA,EAAA,gCAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,QAAA,EAAAV,EAAA;AAAAW,IAAAA,QAAA,EAAA,iPAGA;IDQYC,MAAA,EAAA,CAAA,0DAAA,CAAA;AAAAC,IAAAA,YAAA,EAAA,CAAA;AAAAC,MAAAA,IAAA,EAAA,UAAA;AAAAP,MAAAA,IAAA,EAAAQ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;YAAaC;AAAe,KAAA,EAAA;AAAAF,MAAAA,IAAA,EAAA,WAAA;MAAAP,IAAA,EAAAU,EAAA,CAAAC,kBAAA;AAAAT,MAAAA,QAAA,EAAA,sBAAA;AAAAU,MAAAA,MAAA,EAAA,CAAA,oBAAA,EAAA,4BAAA,CAAA;MAAAC,OAAA,EAAA,CAAA,0BAAA;KAAA;AAAA,GAAA,CAAA;;;;;;QAE3BxB,2BAA2B;AAAAyB,EAAAA,UAAA,EAAA,CAAA;UANvCnB,SAAS;AACEoB,IAAAA,IAAA,EAAA,CAAA;AAAAb,MAAAA,QAAA,EAAA,gCAAgC;AAGjCc,MAAAA,OAAA,EAAA,CAACR,WAAW,EAAEC,eAAe,CAAC;AAAAL,MAAAA,QAAA,EAAA,iPAAA;MAAAC,MAAA,EAAA,CAAA,0DAAA;KAAA;;;;;;"}
