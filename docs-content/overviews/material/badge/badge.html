<div class="docs-markdown"><p>Badges are small status descriptors for UI elements. A badge consists of a small circle,
typically containing a number or other short set of characters, that appears in proximity to
another object.</p>
<p>Badges must always be applied to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements">block-level elements</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="badge-position" class="docs-header-link">
          <span header-link="badge-position"></span>
          Badge position
        </h3>
      <p>By default, the badge will be placed <code>above after</code>. The direction can be changed by defining
the attribute <code>matBadgePosition</code> follow by <code>above|below</code> and <code>before|after</code>.</p>
<div material-docs-example="badge-overview"
                             file="badge-overview-example.html"
                             region="mat-badge-position"></div>

<p>The overlap of the badge in relation to its inner contents can also be defined
using the <code>matBadgeOverlap</code> tag. Typically, you want the badge to overlap an icon and not
a text phrase. By default it will overlap.</p>
<div material-docs-example="badge-overview"
                             file="badge-overview-example.html"
                             region="mat-badge-overlap"></div>


        <h3 id="badge-sizing" class="docs-header-link">
          <span header-link="badge-sizing"></span>
          Badge sizing
        </h3>
      <p>The badge has 3 sizes: <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code> and <code>large</code>. By default, the badge is set to <code>medium</code>.</p>
<p>Badges that are <code>small</code> do not show the label text. This can be useful in contexts such as showing there are unread notifications but not needing to show the exact amount.</p>
<p>You can change the size by adding <code>matBadgeSize</code> to the host element.</p>
<div material-docs-example="badge-overview"
                             file="badge-overview-example.html"
                             region="mat-badge-size"></div>


        <h3 id="badge-visibility" class="docs-header-link">
          <span header-link="badge-visibility"></span>
          Badge visibility
        </h3>
      <p>The badge visibility can be toggled programmatically by defining <code>matBadgeHidden</code>.</p>
<div material-docs-example="badge-overview"
                             file="badge-overview-example.html"
                             region="mat-badge-hide"></div>


        <h3 id="accessibility" class="docs-header-link">
          <span header-link="accessibility"></span>
          Accessibility
        </h3>
      <p>You must provide a meaningful description via <code>matBadgeDescription</code>. When attached to an interactive
element, <code>MatBadge</code> applies this description to its host via <code>aria-describedby</code>. When attached to
a non-interactive element, <code>MatBadge</code> appends a visually-hidden, inline description element. The
badge determines interactivity based on whether the host element is focusable.</p>
<p>When applying a badge to a <code>&lt;mat-icon&gt;</code>, it is important to know that <code>&lt;mat-icon&gt;</code> is
<code>aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;</code> by default. If the combination of icon and badge communicates meaningful
information, always surface this information in another way. <a href="https://material.angular.io/components/icon/overview#indicator-icons">See the guidance on indicator
icons for more information</a>.</p>
