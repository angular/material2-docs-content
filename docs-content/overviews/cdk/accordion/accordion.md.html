<div class="docs-markdown"><p>An accordion is a component with one or more expandable sections. CDK accordion provides a
foundation upon which you can build your own custom accordion component. CDK accordion provides
logic for the accordion interaction pattern without any styles. You can customize the accordion&#39;s
appearance based on your application&#39;s needs.</p>

          Accessibility
        </h3>
      <p>The CDK accordion doesn&#39;t come with any accessibility treatment, because it doesn&#39;t have control
over its markup. We recommend to set the accordion trigger element as a <code>role=&quot;button&quot;</code> while
the body container as a <code>role=&quot;region&quot;</code>. Furthermore, the trigger should have <code>aria-controls</code>
pointing to the body and <code>aria-expanded</code> based on the expanded state, while the body should have
an <code>aria-labelledby</code> that points to the header. See the example above for a sample implementation.</p>
