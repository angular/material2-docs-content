          Behavior captured by CdkStepper
        </h3>
      <p>The base CDK version of the stepper primarily manages which step is active. This includes handling
keyboard interactions and exposing an API for advancing or rewinding through the workflow.</p>

          Linear stepper
        </h4>
      <p>A stepper marked as <code>linear</code> requires the user to complete previous steps before proceeding.
For each step, the <code>stepControl</code> attribute can be set to the top level <code>AbstractControl</code> that
is used to check the validity of the step.</p>
<p>There are two possible approaches. One is using a single form for stepper, and the other is
using a different form for each step.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don&#39;t want to use the Angular forms, you can pass in the <code>completed</code> property
to each of the steps which won&#39;t allow the user to continue until it becomes <code>true</code>. Note that if
both <code>completed</code> and <code>stepControl</code> are set, the <code>stepControl</code> will take precedence.</p>

          Using a single form for the entire stepper
        </h4>
      <p>When using a single form for the stepper, any intermediate next/previous buttons within the steps
must be set to <code>type=&quot;button&quot;</code> in order to prevent submission of the form before all steps are
complete.</p>

          Using a form for each individual step
        </h4>
      <p>When using a form for each step, the workflow is advanced whenever one of the forms is submitted.</p>

          <span header-link="optional-step"></span>
          Optional step
        </h4>
      <p>If completion of a step in linear stepper is not required, then the <code>optional</code> attribute can be set
on <code>CdkStep</code> in a <code>linear</code> stepper.</p>

        <h4 id="editable-step" class="docs-header-link">
          <span header-link="editable-step"></span>
          Editable step
        </h4>
      <p>By default, steps are editable, which means users can return to previously completed steps and
edit their responses. <code>editable=&quot;false&quot;</code> can be set on <code>CdkStep</code> to change the default.</p>

        <h4 id="completed-step" class="docs-header-link">
          <span header-link="completed-step"></span>
          Completed step
        </h4>
      <p>By default, the <code>completed</code> attribute of a step returns <code>true</code> if the step is valid (in case of
linear stepper) and the user has interacted with the step. The user, however, can also override
this default <code>completed</code> behavior by setting the <code>completed</code> attribute as needed.</p>

          <span header-link="stepper-buttons"></span>
          Stepper buttons
        </h3>
      <p>There are two button directives to support navigation between different steps:
<code>CdkStepperNext</code> and <code>CdkStepperPrevious</code>. When placed inside a step, these will automatically
add click handlers to advance or rewind the workflow, respectively.</p>

          Resetting a stepper
        </h3>
      <p>If you want to reset a stepper to its initial state, you can use the <code>reset</code> method. Note that
resetting it will call <code>reset</code> on the underlying form control which clears the value.</p>

          Accessibility
        </h3>
      <p>Apart from the built-in keyboard support, the stepper doesn&#39;t apply any treatment. When implementing
your own component, it is recommended that the stepper is treated as a tabbed view for accessibility
purposes by giving it a <code>role=&quot;tablist&quot;</code>. The header of step that can be clicked to select the step
should be given <code>role=&quot;tab&quot;</code>, and the content that can be expanded upon selection should be given
<code>role=&quot;tabpanel&quot;</code>. Furthermore, the step header should have an <code>aria-selected</code> attribute that
reflects its selected state.</p>
<p>You can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/material/stepper">Angular Material stepper</a> as an example of an accessible implementation.</p>
