Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord ` +\n          `of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the ` +\n          `midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could ` +\n          `even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway ` +\n          `to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only ` +\n          `thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. ` +\n          `Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice ` +\n          `killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.`;\n}\n","<label for=\"clipboard-example-textarea\">Text to be copied</label>\n<textarea id=\"clipboard-example-textarea\" cols=\"30\" rows=\"10\" [(ngModel)]=\"value\"></textarea>\n<button [cdkCopyToClipboard]=\"value\">Copy to clipboard</button>\n","import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';\nimport {ClipboardModule} from '@angular/cdk/clipboard';\nimport {CdkClipboardOverviewExample} from './cdk-clipboard-overview/cdk-clipboard-overview-example';\n\nexport {CdkClipboardOverviewExample};\n\nconst EXAMPLES = [CdkClipboardOverviewExample];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [ClipboardModule, FormsModule],\n  declarations: EXAMPLES,\n  exports: EXAMPLES,\n  entryComponents: EXAMPLES,\n})\nexport class CdkClipboardExamplesModule {\n}\n","/**\n * Generated bundle index.
